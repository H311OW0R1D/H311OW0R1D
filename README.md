Hello! I'm H311OW0R1D, or KJ. I'm a Discord bot dev, and a huge open source nerd. My project KJBOT is a Discord bot I made to avoid bots that have paid premiums; the only payment is optional and grants you access to the beta testing version of the bot. It's features include moderation, fun, and general utility. I'm currently trying to learn SQL and Java, and a little bit of JavaScript. You can reach me via dev@kjbot.xyz.
