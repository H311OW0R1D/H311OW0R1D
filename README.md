Hello! I'm Kjonaas, or KJ. I'm a Discord bot dev, and a huge open source nerd. My project KJBOT is a Discord bot I made to avoid bots that have paid premiums; the only payment is optional and grants you access to the beta testing version of the bot. It's features include moderation, fun, and general utility. My other bot, GlobeBot, is a purely open source discord bot that uses configuration files. I'm currently trying to learn SQL and Java, and a little bit of JavaScript. You can reach me via dev@kjbot.xyz.
