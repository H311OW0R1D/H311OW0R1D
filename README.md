Hello! I'm Kjonaas, or KJ. I'm an open source developer, a vegan, and a student. I mainly use Python but I'm learning a bit of Kotlin and C++.

## Text Editor:
I use Vim with a fairly simple 40 line .vimrc, using the font JetBrains Mono.
## Computer specs:
I primarily use a Windows 10 Desktop with an AMD Ryzen 3700x, 32 gigabytes of memory, 5 terabytes of storage, and an RTX 3070ti.
Secondarily, I use an Intel MacBook running MacOS 11.6.
## Personal hobbies:
I love to play video games, specifically Team Fortress 2 and more recently ULTRAKILL.
I'm a huge fan of custom mechanical keyboards and use one on my desktop every day!
When I'm not gaming or thinking about mechs, I'm usually watching or reading JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
